## Descrition of Idea
### Problem statement- 
Sometimes we want to host our own quiz on a session like DSA/etc. but available apps apply certain resisttictions like on the number of users. So a platform which can help ample number of users to take same quiz at the same time was needed.<br>
Books are sometimes so hectic while preparing for some competitive exams based on general knowledge. A rather fun and effective learning way is needed to be introduced.<br>
### Proposed Solution-
We propose an app "QUIZZITCH", a platform for everyone to come and host their own generated quiz on a particular topic to share with others which will get autosubmit after a regulated time. <br>
This app also focuses on providing with quizzes on various 18-20 categories that includes knowledge, fun and aims to flourish one's IQ in a least boring way. Some common categories can help in the preparation of exams and one of NITJ's own club- Quest club.
Our app will be a perfect platform for living and moving encyclopedias, who are always ready to test and grow their knowledge.
### Features-
1. Introduction slides- representing the main functionalities of our app.<br>
2. Practice fragment- offers you 20 categories following with difficulty levels, and a quiz on respective category choosen with the number of right questions at the end. <br>
3. Collab fragment- a platform to create or join room with a particular room code to compete with your friends on same categories mentioned before. A screen with ranks and scores will be displayed at the end of the game. <br>
4. Leaderboard- a list showing the scores of all users in descending order giving their ranks accordingly. 
5. Quiz fragment- a tab offering you to generate and host your own quiz which will provide a code that can be shared with 100-150 users. <br>
6. Profile page- a fragment displaying the no. of quizes done, no. of games played and no. of games won. It also shows the display name and email id of the user. 
An AVATAR list of MARVEL characters is also made to allow users to choose among their favourite MARVEL character for their display picture.<br>
## Future Scope-
1. We aim to expand the collab fragment to compete worldwide with random users.<br>
2. We are looking forward to introduce levels in the app which will be unlocked based on the number of points a user earns maintaining an essence of competiton. <br>
3. A user's library could exist where a user can save certain questions for future references. <br>
4. A bet system can be introduced which can make you win the put in bets and earn points.<br>
